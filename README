A hyperparameter optimizer for the TMVA classifiers (BDT, SVM?, KERAS-DNN).

The software is tested with CMSSW9 and ROOT6. After initializing these frameworks just type make.

The current version of the software is tailored for the ttH-gg analysis but can be generalized with few minor modifications.
./TMVAOptimizer <Algorithm> <Hyperparameter arguments>

The python script enabling the hyperparameter scan using HTCONDOR is available upon request.
