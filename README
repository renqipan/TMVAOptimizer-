A hyperparameter optimizer for the TMVA classifiers (BDT, SVM?, KERAS-DNN). It is a wrapper on the TMVA framework. 

The software is tested with CMSSW9 and ROOT6. After initializing these frameworks just type make.

The current version of the software is tailored for the ttH-gg analysis but can be generalized with few minor modifications.
./TMVAOptimizer <Algorithm> <Hyperparameter arguments>

The python script enabling the hyperparameter scan using HTCONDOR is available upon request.
